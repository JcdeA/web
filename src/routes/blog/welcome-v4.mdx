Packetframe has a new control plane! The old API, dashboard, and node orchestrator have been completely rewritten to improve stability and feature set. (See the [api](https://github.com/packetframe/api), [web](https://github.com/packetframe/web), and [infra](https://github.com/packetframe/infra) repos for the full source)

The new version (version 4) is ready for beta testing!

<script>
    import Email from "../../components/Email.svelte";
</script>
If you're looking for stability, stick with the current version for now, but if you want to take v4 for a spin, contact <Email/> and we'll get you set up.

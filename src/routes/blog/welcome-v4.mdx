Packetframe has a new control plane! ðŸŽ‰

To kick off the new year, the API, dashboard, and node orchestrator have been completely rewritten to improve the stability and feature set. (See the [api](https://github.com/packetframe/api), [web](https://github.com/packetframe/web), and [infra](https://github.com/packetframe/infra) repos for the full source)

Ready to get started? Head over to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and migrate your zones with https://github.com/packetframe/pfmigrate.

Legacy accounts will continue working like normal through January, but stay tuned for an update announcing EoL of the old version.

Thank you to all our [community partners](/community) and beta testers for making this possible!
